    # Introduction to Python
    print('''1️⃣ Introduction to Python)
    ✅ What is Python?)
    Python is a high-level, interpreted, dynamically-typed, and general-purpose programming language.
    It is widely used for:
    ✔️ Web Development (Django, Flask)
    ✔️ Data Science (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
    ✔️ Automation & Scripting
    ✔️ Machine Learning & AI
    ✔️ Game Development''')

    print('''"✅ Key Features of Python
    🔹 Easy to Learn – Simple and readable syntax
    🔹 Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
    🔹 Dynamically Typed – No need to define variable types explicitly
    🔹 Extensive Libraries – Built-in and third-party libraries for different use cases''')

    print('''"✅ Why Learn Python?
    ✔️ Beginner-Friendly – Perfect for beginners in programming
    ✔️ Used in Trending Technologies – AI, Data Science, Web Development
    ✔️ Large Community Support – Lots of tutorials, forums, and open-source projects''')

    # Installing Python
    print('''2️⃣ Installing Python
    ✅ How to Install Python
    Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    ✅ Installation Steps (Windows)
    1. Download the latest version of Python from Python.org.

    # Running Python
    print('''3️⃣ Running Python (Interpreter, Scripts, and IDEs)
    ✅ 2. Running a Python Script
    1. Open a text editor (VS Code, Notepad, PyCharm, etc.).
    2. Create a new file script.py and write:
    print(Hello, Python script!
    print("3. Save the file and run it using: python script.py
    ''')
    print("✅ 3. Running Python in an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)")
    print("For better coding experience, use an IDE like:")
    print("✔️ VS Code (Lightweight, customizable)")
    print("✔️ PyCharm (Feature-rich, best for Python projects)")
    print("✔️ Jupyter Notebook (Great for Data Science)\n")
